This is Apple TV application. The application was made using API.

## tvOS SDK

Leverage many of the same frameworks, technologies, and concepts as iOS. Frameworks and technologies, such as Metal, UIKit, CloudKit, and Game Center, let you create rich games and apps that look amazing on Apple TV. TVMLKit templates using XML and JavaScript are available as a framework for tvOS apps and let you use predefined layouts and JavaScript APIs to quickly create beautiful apps ideal for streaming media. And you can use SwiftUI to customize your app interfaces and provide even more functionality.

## Developing tvOS apps

Your tvOS apps can deliver amazing experiences with stunning picture quality through 4K resolution, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 — and immersive sound through Dolby Atmos. And with Picture in Picture, multiuser, and game controller support, you can create even more engaging gaming and interactive experiences.


## Creating apps for Apple TV

We’ve reimagined the TV experience with tvOS — an innovative TV platform that redefines what can be done in the living room. Apple TV features a built-in App Store, making it more entertaining than ever. Now you can deliver incredible and immersive apps and games on the big screen.
